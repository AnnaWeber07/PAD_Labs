## Overview

The Distributed Data Management System for Climate Control Devices is a sophisticated solution designed to monitor, manage, and optimize environmental conditions within controlled agriculture settings like greenhouses and vertical farms. This system leverages microservices architecture and distributed data management to enhance plant growth, automate maintenance, and ensure efficient resource utilization. This distributed system is an important software part of my bachelor thesis project.
